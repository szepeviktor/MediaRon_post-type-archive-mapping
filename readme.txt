<h2>Archive Mapping</h2>

This plugin also allows you to map your custom post type archive pages. Just create a page and go to Settings->Reading to set the page for your archive.

Ensure your post types have <code>has_archive</code> set to true.

The plugin has a new Gutenberg block based on Atomic Blocks that will allow you to select which posts to display on your archive page. It even supports pagination.

See below for an overview of how Archive Mapping works:

<ul>
<li>Select a Public page to use as your post type archive page.</li>
<li>View the archive and you will see the page content instead of the archive content.</li>
<li>Use page templates on your pages for flexibility.</li>
<li>Custom Gutenberg block for showing your posts.</li>
</ul>

== Installation ==

1. Just unzip and upload the "post-type-archive-mapping" folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a custom post type that has an archive
4. Create a page with a custom template. Use the Gutenberg block to show off posts in that Custom Post Type.
5. Go to Settings->Reading and assign the page to the custom post type archive
6. Go to the post type archive and observe the page content is now the archive
